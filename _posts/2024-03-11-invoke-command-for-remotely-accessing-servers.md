Invoke-Command is a PowerShell cmdlet that allows you to run commands or scripts on remote computers or servers. It can be used to remotely access and manage resources on other computers, such as files, processes, and registry keys.

Using Invoke-Command has several benefits:

- It allows you to run commands or scripts on multiple computers or servers simultaneously, which can save time and effort.
- It can help you automate tasks and workflows by running scripts on remote computers or servers.
- It can be used to remotely access resources that are not available locally, such as network shares or printers.
- It provides a consistent interface for accessing and managing resources on different computers or servers, regardless of their operating system or configuration.

Overall, Invoke-Command is a useful and powerful tool for remotely accessing and managing resources on other computers or servers. It can be especially useful in a corporate environment where you need to manage a large number of computers or servers. However, you should be careful when using Invoke-Command, as it can potentially have significant impacts on the performance and security of the remote computers or servers. You should make sure that you have the necessary permissions and follow best practices when using Invoke-Command to avoid any unintended consequences.
