PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft for automating tasks and managing system resources. It was first released in 2006 as part of Windows PowerShell 1.0, which was included in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

PowerShell was designed to be a more powerful and flexible alternative to the traditional command prompt (CMD) in Windows, and it was intended to provide a consistent interface for managing different types of resources, such as files, processes, and registry keys.

Over the years, PowerShell has evolved to become a key component of the Microsoft ecosystem, with versions released for other platforms such as Linux and macOS. It is now widely used by IT professionals and developers for automating tasks, managing Windows systems, and interacting with other vendor technologies.
